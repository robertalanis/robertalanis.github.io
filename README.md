# Portfolio

This is my portflio. It was created with React.js and is deployed on GitHub Pages. The deployed site can be [viewed here](https://robertalanis.github.io/).

## Getting Started

This site is pretty straightforward. You can test the site using the [deployed link](https://robertalanis.github.io/).

If you would like to make changes to code simply clone the respository and follow the instructions below.

### Installing

### `npm install`

Run this command to install all necessary dependencaies after cloning the repository.

## Deployment

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This has also been configured to be hosted on GitHub Pages after it has been deployed.
